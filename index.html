       <p><img src="assets/images/Me2.png" alt="L.Robert Gonzalez, III"> My name is Luis Roberto Gonzalez, III. I was born in El Paso, TX in the month of October. Growing up in a border town taught me about humility and instilled my drive.
        In 2010 I relocated from El Paso to Albuquerue, NM. This is where I learned how to be on my own with out a safty net. That adventure was a great experience, but the weather was too cold for me. In being a child of the desert, I missed the suns warm rays. 
        That is why in 2013 I relocated to Phoenix, AZ. I can actually call this place home! Since I arrive back in 2013, I have worked support for the Real Estate industry and dealing with troubleshooting every
        software that is utilized for their daily functions. In working support, I found myself diving into the Marketing aspect of the industry. This is what lead me down this path of becoming a developer. 
        I find myslef wanting to create, advice, and support any company that may utlize my years of experience. In the years that I have worked in this industry, I have gained knowledge through hard work. 
        I plan on applying this same dedication to all of my future clients, organizations, & relationships</p>
